						<h2>My Project Idea</h2>

					</header>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p> The project concept I have is a virtual reality gaming room where you would walk inside of a enclosed space about 3 metres by 3 metres covered in projections of what ever game you have chosen to play. Inside the room are all sorts of different detection devices – primarily cameras but potentially also standing on a tread mill or something that can detect running/walking/jumping sorts of movements in collaboration with a camera. The idea being that you walk into this room and everything becomes interactable around you and everything you do is captured and translates into this game/simulation that you are playing. The options now become quite limitless as to what sort of activity you could enter yourself into.</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>This project could have numerous health and entertainment benefits. The health benefits are what could really be a game changer in this industry. It can be used a tool for creating better exercise habits but then at the same time can offer people the opportunity to relax and unwind whilst playing their new favourite game. These two things could be linked encouraging or forcing users to do even amounts of both. The gaming industry is always looking for innovation and this kind of set up would give developers more tools and opportunities to change the way we currently game.</p>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The virtual reality room would house as many cameras and other devices as necessary to be able to capture all forms of movement and input from a user. Treadmills or bikes could be set up within the room to create a possible sport/exercise simulation as well. The health side could be capable of more than just straight up exercise. The vision would be for physios to use it to track the way people move in all plains of motion and work out what is causing someone to suffer from a particular injury. Doctors could potentially diagnose people’s illnesses if the room were equipped with the appropriate medical devices such as temperature sensors, heart rate monitor and other human vital tracking equipment. All these uses would be able to be done remotely as well which has become a very necessary capability. Some other health benefits I can see would be doctors/health care professionals being able to prescribe exercise to people and being able to have it all tracked within this room to ensure that not only is the patient doing that they are doing it correctly.</p>
					<p>The second use of this would be to play fully interactive games in a similar way to how virtual reality games are played now but this would take it another step. Screens/projections would fully encompass the user so every way that they turned that would be their first-person view of their characters view within a game. It is as if they are playing a game first person from their own perspective and this is just one possible game style. Players would be able to interact with everything in the game like they currently do in a virtual reality game but to greater degree than it currently does. You would walk around and the game would move with you, you would swing a punch at an enemy and you would receive visual and audio feed back about what this has done to your enemy within the game, you could run from enemies and the list goes. There would be capability for multiple players in the same world which could involve walls of projection being dedicated to one-person ie. 4 people playing the same game, but they are all facing a different wall for a less immersive experience at the expense of playing with mates. Sport games would be similarly to how Wii sport games and virtual reality headset games are now, but you would be able to simulate a tennis player being on the court within a stadium. The immersion would be unlike anything we have seen in a game before.</p>
					<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
					<p>The simulations and recording devices would all be powered by a PC/console in a similar fashion to how they are now with virtual reality headsets. The processing power required would be quite high for a game considering the amount of pixels it would need to be projecting around the user as is already the case currently with VR games. As mentioned, cameras and other medical equipment could all be included depending on the use case of each client. There would need to be special software written for any medical uses ie physio diagnosing clients. Game developers would also need to create games for this new viewing aspect. </p>
					<p>The skills required would be a variety of hardware configuration whilst customizing software to the exact specifications and capabilities of the hardware. I don’t have a huge amount of knowledge in how tracking software all works but I am aware that there are devices that can track even just your eye movements so integration with that what VR currently does would be required. Overall, the feasibility of the project would be quite high but very costly at this point in time. In time these pieces of hardware would become more readily available and even more accurate. </p>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>If the project is successful we would have a new tool for engaging people in both entertainment activities and physical exercise as well as the potential to open up a whole new space in health related diagnostics from a remote location. This could have a huge impact if it can get to a point of mass production as it would allow for people in remote areas or even people in populated areas to get diagnostic advice from any practitioner in the world should their ailment be conducive to external visual diagnosing. Also we would have the next generation of VR gaming opening up a world of new and exciting ways to play games.</p>
