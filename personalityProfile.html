					<h2>Test analysis</h2>
<p>The results I receive for personality tests don’t mean a whole lot to me. No one test is going to be able to define a person and as such they should be used very loosely as a guide for what ever their purpose is within a workplace. The results I received for Myers briggs was ISTJ which is the most common result for males <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISTJ">16% of all males</a> per Truity website it means that I am introverted, sensing, thinking and judging. Having read the small brief on this personality type I do believe it sounds quite like me though without reading other types it is too early to make a judgement of whether it is the best suited personality type to match me. The learning styles test has indicated that I am mostly a tactile learner. My qualms with this test was that the questions were quite obvious in what they were leaning towards which may have caused bias. Visual was a close second and finally auditory learning. This seems quite applicable to me. A learning styles test is a bit more definitive than personality test so I would be more likely to take this on board. Finally I did a deloitte business chemistry test and it determined I was a driver primarily with guardian traits. This indicates that I am quantitative and logical which has similarities and overlap with the myers briggs test results.</p>
<p>These results can be helpful in a team situation and may influence me slightly as I know I can bring certain skills to a group situation. Knowing my strengths in a group can give me confidence to help add especially if believe the group is deficient in an area that I excel at. At the same time it can be useful for others to try and grow in areas that they are weaker in so by not being overly dominant in my areas I can share my thoughts and develop others.</p>
<p>This information can be used but is definitely not the be all and end all of group formation. There are other personality traits that aren’t accounted for in these kinds of tests. Relationships within the group can have a far greater impact and cannot be measured by tests. A harmonious group of like minded personalities will be able to come together and have more success than different groups forcefully formed together as they have compatible group roles/personalities.</p>
