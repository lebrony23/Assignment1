					<h3>Personal information </h3
					<p>I am 30 years old and currently looking to broaden my learning with an IT degree. I have previously studied a Bachelor of Business, majoring in finance. I currently work full time in accounts for a small-medium sized retail company but figure I might be more suited to an IT career in the future or at a  minimum a slight change in role at my current job towards the IT side of things. I was born in Melbourne and only speak English. After a handful of travel experiences I wish I had learned another language but the best I’ve been able to accomplish is the German module of Duolingo. A fact about me is that I ran the Melbourne half marathon last year and came 499th out of 11,000 participants it was my first half marathon and I had never ran further than 15km before that, having a hockey playing background definitely helped with the fitness though.</p>
					<h3>My interest in IT</h3>
					<p>My interest in IT started when my dad won a computer (intel 486) when I was about 4 or 5 years old and ever since then I have been fascinated. This would have been the catalyst for my interest in IT, dad also worked in IT project management as well. I have always had an interest in technology whether it be a building computers, playing the latest consoles or getting the newest phone. I don’t currently have much IT experience other than a few high school subjects which involved flash and html. In my current job my team often comes to me to help them with any minor IT issues they might have as our company doesn’t have an IT division onsite.</p>
					<p>I chose to come to RMIT as it is a well-established and well-known university close to where I live in Collingwood. I have enrolled to a COVID short course of just 6 months to see how I go with the subjects and see if I would like to purse it further in the future.</p>
					<p>	I am expecting to learn a variety of different things from my studies. Given it is only for 1 semester it will be limited compared to a full course but I am hoping to get a good grasp on some aspects of coding, so far I have been really enjoying learning Java and this assignment will expose me to HTML again. User centred design will give me an insight into what I actually use and see on a day to day basis and how decisions are made when changes are made to apps and programs. Applications of IT in the real world will hopefully be demonstrated to me in this course as well as job opportunities that I may not know exist yet.</p>

					<h3>Ideal job</h3>
					<h4>Seek Job Ad</h4>
					<a href="images/boeingJob.png"><img src="images/thumbnail_boeingJob.png" alt="Seek screenshot" title="Click to enlarge"></a>
					<p></p>
					<h4>Description</h4>
					<p>The job is for a cyber security specialist – I imagine they are responsible for ensuring their network and computer systems are all protected from cyber attacks as well as internal attacks (staff opening malicious files). In this case the company is Boeing who have a massive international presence and it would be imperative that their systems cannot be hacked or compromised. This would be a fulfilling job working in team to prevent and mitigate these attacks from happening. There would be times of extreme pressure which I believe I would be suited to due to experience playing high level team sport and meeting tight deadlines in my current work role. I think the role would take quite a high general level of knowledge whilst being able to specialise as my career develops and expand my skill set.</p>

					<h4>Qualifications</h4>
					<p>A cyber security specialist would need to be proficient with computers and networks. They would need to have a solid understanding of how networks work at a corporate/business level as well as how all the security and other measures work to prevent attacks from external parties. They would need to be able to problem solve under pressure and make quick decisions. Troubleshooting and working within a team as mentioned before would also be important to come up with the best solutions. </p>
					<p>The skills and qualifications I currently have are the undertaking of a Bachelor of Business majoring in finance as well as 4 years in the industry working for a small retail company in accounts. My current role is completing monthly balance sheet recs of various accounts in our business and requires stringent timing and meeting of deadlines, attention to detail and working in a team environment. All of which I believe would crossover well into this kind of role albeit a vastly different technical skill set. I have been a co-captain of a hockey team that as given me particular leadership skills that I can draw on if needed as well. </p>
					<p>I am currently doing a Covid short course in IT to see if I can broaden my horizons or maybe even have a complete career shift. This is just the start of gaining more qualifications for this area. As I currently work full-time I am hoping that within my current organisation I can get exposure to the IT aspects of the business. My thoughts are that getting experience in the workplace is far and away the best sort of experience you can have and will help you develop and understand your own abilities in the most efficient way. Completing a full Undergrad degree and then potentially doing further studies after that would be another pathway to gaining the knowledge to get to my dream job. As the spec mentions this may vary over the course of my career especially early on I may find that my interests are not in cyber security and that I will very quickly steer away from that but I think the general principles of study and work place experience will still apply.</p>
